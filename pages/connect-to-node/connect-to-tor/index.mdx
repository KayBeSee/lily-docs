# Connect to Tor

Connections to certain nodes require running Tor on your machine in order to connect. This will connect your machine to the Tor network which provides greater privacy.

Unfortunately tor doesn't work out of the box with Lily, so there are a few steps that must be run.

## Mac Instructions

We will need to install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to make it easy to run Tor.

###### Paste the following into a Terminal window:

<CopyCommand command={`/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`} />

##### Once that completes, run:

<CopyCommand command={`brew install tor`} />

##### Then run:

<CopyCommand command={`tor`} />

The output should look like:

## Windows Instructions

Install Tor from the Tor Project's website [here](https://www.torproject.org/download/tor/).

Unzip the file, open the "Tor" folder inside it and install "tor.exe"

Then run Tor after it is done installing.


## Linux Instructions
Run the following apt-get command to install Tor on your machine.

<CopyCommand command={`sudo apt-get install tor`} />

##### Then run:

<CopyCommand command={`tor`} />
