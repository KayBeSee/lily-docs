# Connect to Tor

Unfortunately tor doesn't work out of the box with Lily, so there are a few steps that must be run.

## on Mac

We will need to install Homebrew (https://brew.sh/) to make it easy to run Tor.

### Paste the following into a Terminal window:

`/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`

### Once that completes, run:

`brew install tor`

### Then run:

`tor`

The output should look like:
