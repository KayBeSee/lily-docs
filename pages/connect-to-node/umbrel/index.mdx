# Umbrel Setup

Umbrel is a software suite that can be purchased to easily run your own bitcoin node. You can connect your Lily Wallet to your Umbrel over Tor. Detailed instructions on how to do that are listed below.

#### 1) Get your Umbrel RPC password

To get your Umbrel RPC password, visit [http://umbrel.local/connect/lily-wallet](http://umbrel.local/connect/lily-wallet) while connected to the same network as your Umbrel. Make a note of this password, as it will be used in Step 4.
