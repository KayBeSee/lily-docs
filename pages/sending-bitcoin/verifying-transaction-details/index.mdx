# Verifying Transaction Details

Bitcoin transactions cannot be reversed, so it is important to always verify information whenever approving a transaction both on the device and machine you are using.

This process is easy with Lily...

#### 1) Click the "..." menu next to Transaction Summary and select "View more details".
