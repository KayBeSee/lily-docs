# Airgap - Coldcard

The Coldcard MK3 has a MicroSD card slot which allows data to be transferred via PSBT files (.psbt) without having to plug it into your computer. Lily allows PSBT files to be imported and exported to use with Coldcard.

While this process is more cumbersome, it does provide an extra layer of security by not directly exposing the device to your machine where malicious code could be running.

#### 1) Create a transaction in Lily and click "Save transaction to file" in the transaction summary menu.

#### 3) Remove the MicroSD from your computer, plug it into your Coldcard, and click "Ready to Sign"
