# License

In order to use Lily, you must purchase a license. Your license unlocks the specified features within the application for you to use. Depending on what tier license you purchase, different features become available.

Most tiers are differentiated by the number of devices used to secure your coins or the level of support available. Please review the table below to determine which tier is right for you.

The license itself is a string signed by a private key controlled by Lily Technologies, Inc. and is valid for 52,560 blocks (approximately one year). As always, purchasing a license doesn't require any KYC/AML information.
