# Part 2: Setup Hardware Wallet

Most folks who are setting up Lily for the first time already have used a hardware wallet in the past with software like Ledger Live, Trezor Wallet, or Electrum.

We will begin this tutorial by going through connecting a single hardware wallet to Lily.

#### 3) Give the account a name and click continue

Give your account a name to identify it when you are managing multiple accounts. For single hardware devices, users typically use the name of the device. Users can change the account name later on the account's settings page.
